/**
1. In the main method, instantiate a Scanner object and then instantiate a String object equal to a scanned input. Be sure to close the scanner at the bottom of your main method before testing any code. 

2. Make and test a void method printSecondAndLastLetter that will print the second character and last character in the passed String.  

3. Make and test a method findTheEthat returns the index of the first 'e' character in a passed String. 

4. Make and test a method getLength that returns the amount of characters (the length) of a passed String. 

5. Make and test a void method printFirstAndLastThree that is passed a string and prints the first three and last three characters in a passed String.
